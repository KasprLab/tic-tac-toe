Background
The app was the first ever coding project that was given to me during my bootcamp. I remember finding this assignment quite challanging and end up coding along with other people work back then and tweek it to personalize the code. This time, I made it fully by myself from scratch (insert: proud)

Tech stack:

- HTML
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- DOM
- Heroku
