# tic-tac-toe

Background\s
The app was the first ever coding project that was given to me during my bootcamp. I remember finding this assignment quite challanging and end up coding along with other people work back then and tweek it to personalize the code. This time, I made it fully by myself from scratch (insert: proud)

Tech stack:

- HTML
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- DOM
- Heroku

Project Journal

Tuesday, 13/07/2021 - After reviewing the app, I realized that I have not update Github with the latest version. I have made a list of a few things to do and will need to go through them

Friday, 16/07/2021 - I've updated the production version with codes from test app today. Finally I can go through the app and list areas need to be improve and features to be added.
