# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Background

The app was the first ever coding project that was given to me during my bootcamp. I remember finding this assignment challanging and end up geeting a copy from a source code then redo it myself. This time, I made it fully by myself from scratch :smile:

Tech stack:

- HTML
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- HTML DOM
- Surge
